### Worker Actions
- Fill holistic direct-question answers with screenshot-grounded yes/no/partial judgments.
- Fill every screen row with visible text and screen-specific critique.
- Fill workflow/persona scorecards for every reviewed workflow/persona pair.
- Resolve every evidenceRepairWorkItem before assigning UI implementation work for that same community/workflow/persona.
- Keep reviewer context limited to screenshots, blueprint, evidence, and pass criteria.

### Implementation Guidance
- Inspect `apps/loom_communities_demo/lib` for the primary community home, shell, card, detail, and workflow surface widgets.
- Compare every change against `docs/Build Plan V2/Evidence/B25/production-ux-blueprint.md` before coding.
- Update widget tests and B25 evidence expectations when user-facing hierarchy, copy, or surface structure changes.

### Affected Screen Rows

Showing 9 of 9 affected screen rows.

| Screen row | Community | Workflow | Persona | State | Exact UX failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b25-v4-row-008-garden-export-custom-schemas-1` | Garden Club | `garden-export-custom-schemas` | owner | B13_ext_garden_club_garden-export-custom-schemas_action | LLM vision critique: This remains a generic workflow/action template. Even if export is a supporting/admin flow, the surface is not production-grade because it exposes implementation taxonomy. LLM required fix: Redesign as an export package review screen with file/package identity, included data types, redaction summary, checksum, destination, audit trail, rollback/change-scope controls, and final generate/download action. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-011-book-nomination-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-nomination` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-nomination_action | LLM vision critique: This is not a book nomination product surface. It does not show a title, author, member rationale, genre, meeting context, voting/nomination state, or a natural review/submit form. LLM required fix: Replace with a real book nomination form/review screen including book title, author, reason for nomination, meeting cycle, visibility/privacy settings if needed, edit/cancel, and submit nomination result. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `blocker`. |
| `b25-v4-row-014-book-vote-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-vote` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-vote_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-017-book-meeting-rsvp-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-meeting-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-meeting-rsvp_action | LLM vision critique: Unlike the improved Garden RSVP, this event screen remains a template. It does not feel like a book club meeting page because it lacks the book, venue, time, discussion host, attendee state, and concrete RSVP controls. LLM required fix: Create a book meeting RSVP detail screen with meeting title, selected book, date/time, venue, host, capacity, current RSVP, attendee/reminder state, and natural RSVP/change-response controls. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-020-book-discussion-message-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-discussion-message` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-discussion-message_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-023-book-selection-publish-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-selection-publish` | owner | B14_ext_book_club_book-selection-publish_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-074-mosque-announcement-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-announcement` | owner | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-announcement_action | LLM vision critique: This is not yet a production announcement authoring or preview experience. It documents that an announcement can be sent, but does not look like a real admin composing and publishing a message to members. LLM required fix: Replace with a true announcement composer/review screen including subject, body, audience, schedule/channel, preview, save draft, publish, and sent/receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-077-mosque-event-rsvp-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-event-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-event-rsvp_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-080-mosque-volunteer-signup-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-volunteer-signup` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-volunteer-signup_action | LLM vision critique: This does not feel like a volunteer signup flow. A member should see a specific shift, time, role, requirements, contact preference, confirmation, and coordinator follow-up. LLM required fix: Build a volunteer shift signup surface with shift details, time/location, role requirements, contact/privacy controls, cancel/change option, signup confirmation, and coordinator receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |

### Commit Boundary

Commit this remediation batch, refreshed evidence, judge outputs, scorecards, and tracker updates before the next UX feedback loop. If the committed pass still fails, the following pass starts by sending its tickets to the Remediation Planner.

## B25-RB-002-domain-native-ux-remediation: Remediate domain-native IA and primary workflow surfaces

Apply product UX fixes found by the independent critique so primary screens feel like production community surfaces.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | open |
| Ticket IDs | B25-RT-004-b25-c04-modern-intentional-ui, B25-RT-005-b25-c05-community-content-ia, B25-RT-006-b25-c09-no-layout-production-defects |

### Worker Actions
- Start only after the matching evidenceRepairWorkItems have concrete personas, screenshot-derived visible text, and screen-specific critiques.
- Replace any primary global workflow lists, metadata pages, checklist modals, or repeated generic cards with domain-native surfaces.
- Rebuild primary homes and flows around community content and jobs-to-be-done.
- Improve hierarchy, spacing, typography, component quality, navigation clarity, and mobile layout.
- Update copy/content so visible UI speaks to the target persona and task, not to validation mechanics.

### Implementation Guidance
- Inspect `apps/loom_communities_demo/lib` for the primary community home, shell, card, detail, and workflow surface widgets.
- Compare every change against `docs/Build Plan V2/Evidence/B25/production-ux-blueprint.md` before coding.
- Update widget tests and B25 evidence expectations when user-facing hierarchy, copy, or surface structure changes.

### Affected Screen Rows

Showing 9 of 9 affected screen rows.

| Screen row | Community | Workflow | Persona | State | Exact UX failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b25-v4-row-008-garden-export-custom-schemas-1` | Garden Club | `garden-export-custom-schemas` | owner | B13_ext_garden_club_garden-export-custom-schemas_action | LLM vision critique: This remains a generic workflow/action template. Even if export is a supporting/admin flow, the surface is not production-grade because it exposes implementation taxonomy. LLM required fix: Redesign as an export package review screen with file/package identity, included data types, redaction summary, checksum, destination, audit trail, rollback/change-scope controls, and final generate/download action. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-011-book-nomination-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-nomination` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-nomination_action | LLM vision critique: This is not a book nomination product surface. It does not show a title, author, member rationale, genre, meeting context, voting/nomination state, or a natural review/submit form. LLM required fix: Replace with a real book nomination form/review screen including book title, author, reason for nomination, meeting cycle, visibility/privacy settings if needed, edit/cancel, and submit nomination result. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `blocker`. |
| `b25-v4-row-014-book-vote-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-vote` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-vote_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-017-book-meeting-rsvp-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-meeting-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-meeting-rsvp_action | LLM vision critique: Unlike the improved Garden RSVP, this event screen remains a template. It does not feel like a book club meeting page because it lacks the book, venue, time, discussion host, attendee state, and concrete RSVP controls. LLM required fix: Create a book meeting RSVP detail screen with meeting title, selected book, date/time, venue, host, capacity, current RSVP, attendee/reminder state, and natural RSVP/change-response controls. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-020-book-discussion-message-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-discussion-message` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-discussion-message_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-023-book-selection-publish-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-selection-publish` | owner | B14_ext_book_club_book-selection-publish_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-074-mosque-announcement-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-announcement` | owner | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-announcement_action | LLM vision critique: This is not yet a production announcement authoring or preview experience. It documents that an announcement can be sent, but does not look like a real admin composing and publishing a message to members. LLM required fix: Replace with a true announcement composer/review screen including subject, body, audience, schedule/channel, preview, save draft, publish, and sent/receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-077-mosque-event-rsvp-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-event-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-event-rsvp_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-080-mosque-volunteer-signup-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-volunteer-signup` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-volunteer-signup_action | LLM vision critique: This does not feel like a volunteer signup flow. A member should see a specific shift, time, role, requirements, contact preference, confirmation, and coordinator follow-up. LLM required fix: Build a volunteer shift signup surface with shift details, time/location, role requirements, contact/privacy controls, cancel/change option, signup confirmation, and coordinator receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |

### Commit Boundary

Commit this remediation batch, refreshed evidence, judge outputs, scorecards, and tracker updates before the next UX feedback loop. If the committed pass still fails, the following pass starts by sending its tickets to the Remediation Planner.

## B25-RB-003-recapture-rerun-closeout: Recapture evidence, rerun judges, and close resolved tickets

Prove the remediation with fresh screenshots, scorecards, and a committed iteration boundary.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | open |
| Ticket IDs | B25-RT-001-b25-c01-no-blocker-major, B25-RT-002-b25-c03-production-grade-experience, B25-RT-003-b25-c14-llm-vision-ux-review, B25-RT-004-b25-c04-modern-intentional-ui, B25-RT-005-b25-c05-community-content-ia, B25-RT-006-b25-c09-no-layout-production-defects |

### Worker Actions
- Rebuild and relaunch the Demo App on the reviewed emulator/device.
- Recapture affected screenshots with hashes, timestamps, device metadata, and app commit SHA.
- Regenerate B25 schema v4 review JSON, markdown review, screen matrix, remediation tickets, and iteration scorecard.
- Commit the full iteration before starting the next UX feedback loop.

### Implementation Guidance
- Use each open remediation ticket as the implementation backlog.
- Update review JSON, remediation log, scorecards, tracker, and screenshots together.
- Inspect `apps/loom_communities_demo/lib` for the primary community home, shell, card, detail, and workflow surface widgets.
- Compare every change against `docs/Build Plan V2/Evidence/B25/production-ux-blueprint.md` before coding.
- Update widget tests and B25 evidence expectations when user-facing hierarchy, copy, or surface structure changes.
- Treat the imported LLM vision review as the independent semantic critique.
- Prioritize screen rows and workflows named in `llmVisionReview.findings` and `llmVisionReview.screenReviews`.
- Do not close the ticket until a fresh LLM vision review over after-screenshots passes.

Do not use repeated cards as the whole primary workflow. |
| Flutter sample app implementation patterns | flutter/samples / open-source | https://github.com/flutter/samples | Copy the separation between app shell, route state, domain widgets, and testable UI states rather than hardcoding a single generic renderer. |

| Form validation and review pattern | U.S. Web Design System / design-system | https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form/<br>Also: https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/alert/<br>https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/ | Copy a form flow with field labels, helper text, validation errors, review state, submit action, status, and protected-data treatment. |

### Affected Screen Rows

Showing 11 of 11 affected screen rows.

| Screen row | Community | Workflow | Persona | State | Exact UX failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b25-v4-row-008-garden-export-custom-schemas-1` | Garden Club | `garden-export-custom-schemas` | owner | B13_ext_garden_club_garden-export-custom-schemas_action | LLM vision critique: This remains a generic workflow/action template. Even if export is a supporting/admin flow, the surface is not production-grade because it exposes implementation taxonomy. LLM required fix: Redesign as an export package review screen with file/package identity, included data types, redaction summary, checksum, destination, audit trail, rollback/change-scope controls, and final generate/download action. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-011-book-nomination-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-nomination` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-nomination_action | LLM vision critique: This is not a book nomination product surface. It does not show a title, author, member rationale, genre, meeting context, voting/nomination state, or a natural review/submit form. LLM required fix: Replace with a real book nomination form/review screen including book title, author, reason for nomination, meeting cycle, visibility/privacy settings if needed, edit/cancel, and submit nomination result. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `blocker`. |
| `b25-v4-row-014-book-vote-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-vote` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-vote_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-017-book-meeting-rsvp-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-meeting-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-meeting-rsvp_action | LLM vision critique: Unlike the improved Garden RSVP, this event screen remains a template. It does not feel like a book club meeting page because it lacks the book, venue, time, discussion host, attendee state, and concrete RSVP controls. LLM required fix: Create a book meeting RSVP detail screen with meeting title, selected book, date/time, venue, host, capacity, current RSVP, attendee/reminder state, and natural RSVP/change-response controls. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-020-book-discussion-message-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-discussion-message` | member | B14_ext_book_club_book-discussion-message_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-023-book-selection-publish-1` | Neighborhood Book Club | `book-selection-publish` | owner | B14_ext_book_club_book-selection-publish_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-074-mosque-announcement-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-announcement` | owner | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-announcement_action | LLM vision critique: This is not yet a production announcement authoring or preview experience. It documents that an announcement can be sent, but does not look like a real admin composing and publishing a message to members. LLM required fix: Replace with a true announcement composer/review screen including subject, body, audience, schedule/channel, preview, save draft, publish, and sent/receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-077-mosque-event-rsvp-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-event-rsvp` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-event-rsvp_action | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-080-mosque-volunteer-signup-1` | Masjid Nur | `mosque-volunteer-signup` | member | B14_ext_mosque_mosque-volunteer-signup_action | LLM vision critique: This does not feel like a volunteer signup flow. A member should see a specific shift, time, role, requirements, contact preference, confirmation, and coordinator follow-up. LLM required fix: Build a volunteer shift signup surface with shift details, time/location, role requirements, contact/privacy controls, cancel/change option, signup confirmation, and coordinator receiver state. Current row verdict is `fail` with severity `major`. |
| `b25-v4-row-185-wf-persona-role-inventory-capability-matrix-1` | persona-role-inventory | `wf_persona-role-inventory-capability-matrix` | member | B17_persona_inventory_picker | No row-specific failure recorded. |
| `b25-v4-row-186-wf-demo-app-persona-picker-0` | Masjid Nur | `wf_demo-app-persona-picker` | member | B18_persona_picker_dialog | No row-specific failure recorded. |

### Commit Boundary

Commit this remediation batch, refreshed evidence, judge outputs, scorecards, and tracker updates before the next UX feedback loop. If the committed pass still fails, the following pass starts by sending its tickets to the Remediation Planner.

## Planner Rules

- Worker agents implement from remediation batches, not from optimistic summaries.
- Product-spec work items must be completed and rerun before evidence repair or UI remediation work items for the same community are assigned.
- Evidence repair work items must be completed and rerun before UI remediation work items for the same community/workflow/persona are assigned.
- UI remediation work must be scoped by community/workflow/persona and target production surface, not by a broad global ticket summary.
- The independent judge must rerun after each batch that changes UI, evidence, or critique.
- No next UX feedback loop starts until the current remediation iteration is committed.
